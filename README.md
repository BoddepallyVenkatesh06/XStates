## Getting StartedüéØ

### Prerequisitesüìã

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- React (for the application where XStates will be integrated)

### Installation‚öôÔ∏è

1. Install XStates via npm:

```bash
npm install xstates
```

## Usageüìà

### Basic Setup

1. Create a state machine configuration:

```javascript
import { createMachine } from 'xstates';

const toggleMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'toggle',
  initial: 'inactive',
  states: {
    inactive: {
      on: { TOGGLE: 'active' }
    },
    active: {
      on: { TOGGLE: 'inactive' }
    }
  }
});
```

2. Use the machine in your React component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useMachine } from 'xstates/react';
import { toggleMachine } from './path-to-your-machine';

const ToggleComponent = () => {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(toggleMachine);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => send('TOGGLE')}>
      {state.matches('inactive') ? 'Activate' : 'Deactivate'}
    </button>
  );
};

export default ToggleComponent;
```
